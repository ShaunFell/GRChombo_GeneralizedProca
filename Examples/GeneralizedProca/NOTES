####### Compilation notes

 - Chombo must be compiled and $CHOMBO_HOME must be set to (chombo_root)/lib
 - For compilation for the Baden-Wurttemburg cluster, set 'cxxoptflags = -march=native'
 - For optimizations, add also '-g3' to 'cxxoptflags'

# Optional Flags
To Use AH Finder, the 'XTRACPPFLAGS' must include
                    -I${PETSC_DIR}/include -I${PETSC_DIR}/${PETSC_ARCH}/include -DUSE_AHFINDER
and 'syslibflags' must also include 
                    -L${PETSC_DIR}/${PETSC_ARCH}/lib -lpetsc


#######
####### Parameter Files 

 - There are a number of parameter files in params/ folder that use different flags
 - The one we've currently been using as our 'production' file is 'params_Dynamic_HighRes_AH.txt'
        - This uses 6 refinement levels with a computational box size of 128 and activates the AH locator routine

####### General Notes on Matter Field and Initial Conditions

index of spatial Proca vector is DOWN
index of electric field vector is UP
shift vector is index UP

advection terms are the gradient projected along the shift: \beta^j d_j x_i


Current initial condition of Proca field:
    X_x = A*exp(-r/r0) * 1/sqrt(gamma)
    X_y = -X_x
    X_z = 0
    X_phi = 0
    E^i = 0

Kerr black metric is in form of quasi-isotropic coordinates
