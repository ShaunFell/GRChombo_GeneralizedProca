index of spatial Proca vector is DOWN
index of electric vector is UP
shift vector is index UP

advection terms are the gradient projected along the shift: \beta^j d_j x_i


Current initial condition of Proca field:
    X_x = A*exp(-r/r0) * 1/sqrt(gamma)
    X_y = -X_x
    X_z = 0
    X_phi = 0
    E^i = 0

Kerr black metric is in form of quasi-isotropic coordinates
